# PVOG for anvio

Included here are the files you need for annotating phage genomes with 'prokaryotic virus orthologous groups' (pVOGs). The PVOGs database is described [here](http://dmk-brain.ecn.uiowa.edu/pVOGs/downloads.html).

Until I can figure out how to get `git lfs` working, I have hosted the `genes.hmm.gz` file [here](https://drive.google.com/open?id=1rOQuSBl-MLGcfM_7YFeaSdAipBdPSQhK)
